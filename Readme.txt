How to run the simulation?
1. Extract all the files in the zip folder.

2. Open matlab and change the path to the path where the contents are extracted.

3. Open the "function_runner.m" matlab code file and run it to create variables in workspace that the simulation will follow. Check if the workspace as variables named ts1 ts2 and ts3

4. Open the Simulink File name "Assem_1_ik.slx" and run the simulation.

5. Here you will see the robot follow the hard coded path in the function_runner.m file. If you want to change this path please make necessary changes in the function_runner.m file

How to view the designs?
1. Make sure you have solidworks installed (atleast 2018 version)

2.If you want to see the ball joint design go to the Robot Design with Ball Joints folder and open the Full_robot_Assembly.sldasm file

3.If you want to view the design of 1 individual leg seprately open the Module Assembly.sldasm file

4.If you want to see the wrist joint type design go to the Robot Design with Ball Joints folder and open the Full_robot_Assembly.sldasm file

3.If you want to view the design of 1 individual leg seprately open the Module Assembly.sldasm file
